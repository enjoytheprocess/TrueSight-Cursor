## Recipes & UX

### IDEA-001: Serving size selector

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Let users choose how many people they are cooking for and scale ingredient amounts on recipes accordingly.

**Discussion**

- Overlaps partially with V1 recipe display — clarify minimum V1 behavior vs this enhancement.
- Affects `RecipeSession` serving multiplier in the domain model.

**Outcome:** —

---

### IDEA-002: Cuisine preferences & discovery mode

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Filter and browse recipes by cuisine type; optional “discovery” browsing beyond strict inventory match.

**Discussion**

- V1 may ship a minimal filter; full discovery mode stays ideation until scoped.

**Outcome:** —

---

## Profile & personalization

### IDEA-003: Dietary restrictions & allergy filtering

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Vegan, gluten-free, allergies, etc. filter all recipe suggestions globally.

**Discussion**

- `UserProfile` exists in the domain model; not in V1 roadmap — promote when profile slice is scheduled.

**Outcome:** —

---

### IDEA-004: Cooking skill level & kitchen equipment

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Match recipes to beginner/intermediate/advanced skill and available equipment (oven, air fryer, …).

**Discussion**

- Pairs with IDEA-003 as a “profile” epic if promoted together.

**Outcome:** —

---

## Inventory & UX

### IDEA-011: Shopping list

**Status:** open (P4 parked — build deferred behind V2 photo mockup)  
**Summary:** **In Stock** \| **Shopping List** tabs; add what you have vs what you will buy; **Move to In Stock** after purchase; recipe **pager** below the lists.

**Discussion**

- Supports use case #1 ([use-cases.md](use-cases.md) — at the market).
- Spec drafted: [FEAT-SHP-001](../design/features/FEAT-SHP-001-shopping-list-and-main-shell.md); `CAP-V1-SHOP` parked in AWP roadmap until fridge-photo design advances.

**Outcome:** —

---

### IDEA-006: Expiry proximity warnings

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Notify users when items are close to expiry so they can use them before waste.

**Discussion**

- Could be a small V1 add-on or post-V1; not listed on committed roadmap yet.

**Outcome:** —

---

## Personas

### IDEA-007: Charity / food-bank persona

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Extend the product narrative and future flows for donation kitchens, food banks, and shared fridges — tracking perishables for beneficiaries, not only household users.

**Discussion**

- Motivates the problem space in [project-brief.md](project-brief.md); no charity-specific features on V1/V2 roadmap.
- Promotion would need multi-user/org model, permissions, and compliance review.

**Outcome:** —

---

## Smart input

### IDEA-008: Receipt photo → inventory list

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Photograph a grocery receipt; vision/OCR returns item names, quantities, optional images, and suggested expiration dates for user review before adding to inventory.

**Discussion**

- Related domain shapes: `ReceiptScan`, `DetectedLineItem` in [domain-model.md](domain-model.md).
- Distinct from V2 fridge photo (FEAT-REC-002); may share vision infrastructure if both ship.

**Outcome:** —

---

## Platform

### IDEA-009: PWA install + offline shell

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Web app manifest, service worker, and offline-friendly shell so users can install on home screen and tolerate brief connectivity loss for read-only inventory.

**Discussion**

- Aligns with mobile-first delivery in project brief; depends on frontend slice existing.
- Scope offline data carefully (stale inventory vs recipes).

**Outcome:** —

---

### IDEA-010: Firebase-first stack (alternative)

**Status:** parked  
**Summary:** Alternate “build fast” stack from early product exploration: **React Native + Expo** (or web) on the client, **Firebase Auth + Firestore + Storage + Cloud Functions** on the backend, **Spoonacular/Edamam** for recipes, **OpenAI/Gemini Vision** for V2 fridge photos. **Not** the committed stack — see [ADR-20260523-01](../design/decisions/ADR-20260523-01-delivery-model-pwa-web.md) (mobile-first **web** + ASP.NET Core API).

**Reference layers (parked)**

| Layer | Alternate | Why it was attractive |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| Mobile | React Native + Expo + TypeScript | Fast iOS/Android, strong camera story |
| Backend | Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions | MVP speed, less server ops |
| Recipes | Spoonacular or Edamam | Ingredient ontology, diets, nutrition |
| V2 vision | OpenAI Vision or Gemini Vision | Messy fridge photos vs label-only OCR |
| Helper OCR | Google Cloud Vision | Labels/OCR only — not primary intelligence |

**Reference V1 flow**

1. User adds ingredients manually → Firestore inventory  
2. Cloud Function calls recipe API → rank by match + expiry  
3. “Use recipe” subtracts ingredients  

**Reference V2 flow**

1. Photo → Firebase Storage → Cloud Function → vision model → candidate items  
2. User confirms (confidence per line) → inventory update → better suggestions  

**Reference Firestore shape (conceptual — maps to [domain-model.md](domain-model.md))**

- `users` — profile, dietary prefs, allergies  
- `inventoryItems` — quantity, unit, expiry, `source: manual | photo`, optional `confidenceScore`  
- `recipesSaved` — title, ingredients, missing/used, image, provider id  
- `fridgePhotos` — image URL, status, `detectedItems`  

Committed persistence is **EF Core + SQLite** on the API; entity names differ but the **domain concepts** align.

**Discussion**

- Committed stack: ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQLite + React (PWA-capable web). See [architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md).
- Biggest product risk called out in exploration: **users maintaining inventory** — V1 must make manual input very fast; V2 reduces friction with photo assist + confirmation.
- Revisit only if team explicitly reopens hosting/BaaS trade-offs.

**Outcome:** Parked — documented only; no ADR promotion. Register: `.awp-workspace/0-ideation/archive/IDEATION_BACKLOG.yaml`.

## Commerce & external

### IDEA-005: Store recommendations (distance, price)

**Status:** open  
**Summary:** Suggest where to buy missing ingredients using distance and price comparison.

**Discussion**

- External integrations, privacy, and data sourcing need a spike before promotion.

**Outcome:** —

---

## Promotion checklist

When moving an idea to **promoted**:

1. Add capability or feature to [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) and `.awp-workspace/1-design/ROADMAP.yaml`
2. Add user stories to [user-stories.md](user-stories.md) under the right phase
3. Create `docs/design/features/FEAT-*.md` and register rows (see `.cursor/snippets/awp-admit-task.md`)
4. Move YAML entry to `.awp-workspace/0-ideation/archive/IDEATION_BACKLOG.yaml` with `decision: promoted`
